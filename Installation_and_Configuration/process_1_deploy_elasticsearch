# This is the example with 3 servers (nodes) - 1 master node and 2 data nodes

## TERMINAL
# make the same configurations in terminal for 3 servers


# Connect to root
$ sudo su -

# and enter private ip address password for connecting to root

# Next Download and import the GPG Key which is used to validate all the RPMs that we're going to be using to install Elasticsearch in Kibana.

# RPM Command
$ rpm --import https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch


# now have the GPG key imported on all 3 nodes. so let's go ahead and download the Elasticsearch RPM. (Install the required version)
$ curl -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-7.6.0-x86_64.rpm


# let's go ahead and install
$ rpm --install elasticsearch-7.6.0-x86_64.rpm


# next enable the elasticsearch
# what this does is it's going to create a SIM link that basically starts Elasticsearch up on the system boot. So this is not entirely mandatory, but 9 times out of 10,
# if you have a service like Elasticsearch, you're typically going to have like a dedicated server for something like Elasticsearch, because it is so resource intensive.
# You want stuff like this to start up when a system starts up automatically. So if for any reason, this system were to be restarted or if it were to fail and turn off
# and you turn it back on again, you want all of the primary services to start up automatically, so that it can rejoin the cluster and go back to a green state as quickly as possible.
$ systemctl enable elasticsearch
