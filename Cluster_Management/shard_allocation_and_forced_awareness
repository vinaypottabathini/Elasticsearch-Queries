## Ignore the way of restarting server that's old version.


Configure nodes data-1 and data-2 to have a "zone" node attribute with a value of "1".

Using the Secure Shell (SSH), log in to the data-1 and data-2 nodes as cloud_user via the public IP address.

Become the elastic user with:

sudo su - elastic
In the /home/elastic/elasticsearch/config/elasticsearch.yml file, change the following line:

#node.attr.rack: r1
to

node.attr.zone: 1
Restart the elasticsearch node with:

pkill -F /home/elastic/elasticsearch/pid
/home/elastic/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch -d -p pid

Configure nodes data-3 and data-4 to have a "zone" node attribute with a value of "2".

Using the Secure Shell (SSH), log in to the data-3 and data-4 nodes as cloud_user via the public IP address.

Become the elastic user with:

sudo su - elastic
In the /home/elastic/elasticsearch/config/elasticsearch.yml file, change the following line:

#node.attr.rack: r1
to

node.attr.zone: 2
Restart the elasticsearch node with:

pkill -F /home/elastic/elasticsearch/pid
/home/elastic/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch -d -p pid

Enable shard allocation awareness for the cluster per instructions.

Use the Kibana console tool to execute the following:

PUT _cluster/settings
{
  "persistent": {
    "cluster.routing.allocation.awareness.attributes": "zone",
    "cluster.routing.allocation.awareness.force.zone.values": "1,2"
  }
}

Stop Elasticsearch on nodes data-3 and data-4.

Using the Secure Shell (SSH), log in to the data-3 and data-4 nodes as cloud_user via the public IP address.

Become the elastic user with:

sudo su - elastic
Stop the elasticsearch node with:

pkill -F /home/elastic/elasticsearch/pid

Ensure that all primary shards are assigned and all replica shards remain unassigned.

Use the Kibana console tool to execute the following:

GET _cat/shards?v








##### Update
Correct way of restarting

elasticsearch$ pkill -F pid
elasticsearch$ ./bin/elasticsearch -d -p pid
